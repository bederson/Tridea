  - Update # of ideas displayed

BUGS
  * Can't get initial layout to work without a delay which causes a FLASH
  * Items still get wrapped incorrectly sometimes within groups
  * Deal with long lines in list view
  * Can't delete group with 5 children (transaction error)
  * On appspot, I occasionally get "Transaction collision. Retrying...", and it appears that the transaction never completed

SPECIFICS
  * Pause incremental updates while editing (any recent interaction or open textbox)
  * Make sure you can ungroup on the same interaction that you initially grouped with 
    (to address problem when you start with two boxes on top of each other)
  * Clean up tags ("selected" vs. "hilited")
  * Remember last view by user

CODE QUALITY
  * Store data on nodes with jquery .data() instead of attr()s

FEATURES
  * Friends view
  * Author on mouseover
  * Like button on mouseover
  * Display of # likes
  * Zoom-out view:
    - shows all groups
    - drag to reorder groups
    - Clip to show only first N characters of group label
    - double-click to edit group label
    - Mouse over middle of group to show group contents

LATER
  * Consider dynamics
    - Incremental updates
    - Optional real-time updates (good for projected display)
    - status of external activity
      global on top, or by each thread?
      New ideas, # of likes
  * Ability to reorganize, including reparenting subtrees
  * Make it more obvious to log in when try to edit
  * Add target # of ideas per topic and per person, and show progress with a graph.
  * Design for mobile
  * SECURITY: Make sure that all user is escaped/safe

OPTIONAL
  * Search
     - Click on person to see all ideas by that person
  * More encouragement for short contributions (meter, red color when getting long)
  * Goals to encourage a given number of contributions
